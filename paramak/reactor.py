class Reactor:
    """The Reactor object allows shapes and components to be added and then
    collective operations to be performed on them. Combining all the shapes is
    required for creating images of the whole reactor and creating a Graveyard
    (bounding box) that is needed for neutronics simulations. There are two
    methods available for producing the the DAGMC h5m file. The PyMoab option
    is able to produce non imprinted and non merged geometry so is more suited
    to individual components or reactors without touching surfaces. Trelis is
    the able to produce imprinted and merged DAGMC h5m geometry. Further
    details on imprinting and merging are available on the DAGMC homepage
    https://svalinn.github.io/DAGMC/usersguide/trelis_basics.html . Trelis
    (also known as Cubit) is available from the CoreForm website
    https://www.coreform.com/ version 17.1 is the version of Trelis used when
    testing the Paramak code.

    Args:
        shapes_and_components (list): list of paramak.Shape objects or the
            filename of json file that contains the neutronics description of
            the geometry. The list of dictionaries should each have a
            "material" key containing a material_tag value and a "stp_filename"
            key containing the path to the stp file. See the
            external_stp_file_simulation.py neutronics for a complete example.
            https://github.com/ukaea/paramak/blob/main/examples/example_neutronics_simulations/external_stp_file_simulation.py
        faceting_tolerance: the tolerance to use when faceting surfaces.
        merge_tolerance: the tolerance to use when merging surfaces.
        method: The method to use when making the h5m geometry. Options are
            "trelis" or "pymoab".
        graveyard_size: The dimention of cube shaped the graveyard region used
            by DAGMC. This attribtute is used preferentially over
            graveyard_offset.
        graveyard_offset: The distance between the graveyard and the largest
            shape. If graveyard_size is set the this is ignored.
        largest_shapes: Identifying the shape(s) with the largest size in each
            dimention (x,y,z) can speed up the production of the graveyard.
            Defaults to None which finds the largest shapes by looping through
            all the shapes and creating bounding boxes. This can be slow and
            that is why the user is able to provide a subsection of shapes to
            use when calculating the graveyard dimentions.
