Parametric Reactors
===================

These are reactors designs that can be created from parameters.

The above image is colored by components, instead of by the type of Shape volumes are made from. The TF coils are blue, the PF coils are red, the center coumn shielding is light blue, the blanket is green, the divertor is orange, the firstwall is grey and the rear wall of the blanket is teal.
