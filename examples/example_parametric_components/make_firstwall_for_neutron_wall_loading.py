For some neutronics tallies such as neutron wall loading it is necessary to
segment the geometry so that individual neutronics tallies can be recorded
for each face. This can be done using the PoloidalSegments(). With this
segmented geometry it is then easier to find neutron wall loading as a function
of poloidal angle.
